# Flickr Homepage

Inspired by Yahoo's [flickr extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flickr-tab/bhnpmdabjgpimmnbmhefncbghknfegog), this index page loads and displays random daily interesting photos from flickr. It also caches data when possible to reduce bandwidth usage.

Preview available here: [http://cdn.justinlin.net/flickr/](http://cdn.justinlin.net/flickr/). Refresh that page to see a different image. Feel free to set that page as your homepage.
