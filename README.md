# Flickr Homepage

Inspired by Yahoo's [flickr extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flickr-tab/bhnpmdabjgpimmnbmhefncbghknfegog), this index page loads and displays random daily interesting photos from flickr. It also caches data when possible to reduce bandwidth usage.

Preview available at the link in this repository's description. Refresh that page to see a different image. Feel free to set that page as your homepage.
